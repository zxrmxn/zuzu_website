Hi, I’m **Zuharman**, an IT operations and infrastructure enthusiast with a strong foundation in networking, systems, and support. Over the past few years, I’ve worked in fast-paced environments across banking, automotive, and fintech, where I’ve helped teams stay connected, secure, and efficient.

At **Bank Raya Indonesia**, I’m currently focused on improving product reliability through data analysis, SQL reporting, and quality assurance. Previously at **Mitsubishi DIPO Gatot Subroto**, I handled network infrastructure across multiple branches, managed firewalls, supported users, and even built a real-time monitoring system with Grafana and Prometheus.

I hold LFCA and LFCS certifications from the Linux Foundation, and I’m always looking to grow my skills and take on new technical challenges. I’m passionate about solving problems, improving systems, and being the go-to person when things need fixing or optimizing.

If you’re looking for someone reliable, curious, and hands-on in IT operations, I’d love to connect!
